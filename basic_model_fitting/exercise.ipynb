    "1. Remember that data do not really have error bars. Do not stress about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you plot your best-fitting model over the data, it's nice to show the uncertainty on the model prediction. Since this likelihood is Poisson, this is a little annoying to do in detail (the most sensible \"error bars\" to put on the model are asymmetric). Still, it's visually helpful to show some kind of uncertainty on the model, so you could always plot symmetric $\\sqrt{\\mu(t)}$ error bars ($\\sqrt{\\mu}$ being the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remember that you can throw out terms in the log-likelihood that do not depend on parameters. (However, it so happens that if you keep all the terms in the Poisson log-likelihood, $S$ will have the same nice properties as $\\chi^2$... for a Sufficiently Large number of data points. The data set used here isn't big enough for this to really hold, but it might be fun to compare your distribution of simulated $S_\\mathrm{min}$ values to the $\\chi^2_\\nu$ distribution at the end, to see how different they are. Note that this requires some care in the implementation of the $S$ function, though. If you try this, use Stirling's formula deal with the factorial, and make sure to handle special cases to avoid dividing by zero or taking the log of zero.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Remember that you can use such a minimizer to find the best fit _before_ haphazardly evaluating over a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `curve_fit` is not your friend here, since the likelihood is not Gaussian. You'll want to use something more general, e.g. `scipy.optimize.minimize`."
